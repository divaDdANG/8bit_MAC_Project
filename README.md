# 8bit_MAC_Project
8-bit MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) Unit for Neural Networks
Objective
This project implements an 8-bit Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit, a fundamental building block used in neural network accelerators such as those developed by NVIDIA, Google, Intel, and TSMC.
The design performs efficient arithmetic operations (multiplication + accumulation) essential for deep learning matrix computations.
